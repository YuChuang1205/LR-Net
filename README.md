# LR-Net: A Lightweight and Robust Network for Infrared Small Target Detection [[Paper/arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02780)]
### The network details of LR-Net can be viewed in the project file.  
### I'm sorting out the complete code. Welcome to follow my github.
### !!! Recently, I am working with Zhaojinmiao (the first author of MSDA-Net [[Paper/arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02037)]) to prepare to open source our series of work, including following:
1. The scheme of our 1st prize in the PRCV2024 Wide-area Infrared Small Target Detection Challenge
2. Our scheme of in the ICPR 2024 Resource-Limited Infrared Small Target Detection Challenge Track 1: Weakly Supervised Infrared Small Target Detection. **Already open source, please see the project [[Link](https://github.com/YuChuang1205/Refined-IRSTD-Scheme-with-Single-Point-Supervision)] for details.**

### !!! We are actively preparing to organize the complete training/testing code for your convenience. I will gradually organize and open it.
### !!! At present, when you embed the network model file we provide into your own framework, please pay attention to whether you need to add or remove "Sigmoid" to the last layer of the network.

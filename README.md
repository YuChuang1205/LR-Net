# LR-Net: A Lightweight and Robust Network for Infrared Small Target Detection
### The network details of LR-Net can be viewed in the project file.  
### I'm sorting out the complete code. Welcome to follow my github.
### !!! Recently, I am working with Zhaojinmiao (the first author of MSDA-Net) to prepare to open source our series of work, including following:
1. The scheme of our 1st prize in the PRCV2024 Wide-area Infrared Small Target Detection Challenge
2. Our scheme of in the ICPR 2024 Resource-Limited Infrared Small Target Detection Challenge Track 1: Weakly Supervised Infrared Small Target Detection
3. Our scheme of in the ICPR 2024 Resource-Limited Infrared Small Target Detection Challenge Track 2: Lightweight Infrared Small Target Detection
4. MLCL-Net  
5. ALCL-Net  
6. GGL-Net  
7. MSDA-Net
